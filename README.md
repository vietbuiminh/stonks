## Inspiration

Our Inspiration was the information Google Finance and solving the problem of finding the right company for an investor, or just learn more about the stock before buying

## What it does

Our website not only shows the graph of a particular company but also the news (pulled from The New York Times) so that it can give a good insight to an investor about a particular company.

## How we built it

We used 2 APIs, 1 front-end web framework and 3 programming languages mainly.
**APIs**: - Alpha Vantage:- This API is for fetching the graphs of all the company, New York Times:- We have used this API for fetching the _finance news_ and _stock news_.
**Framework**:- We used _ReactJS_ for the entire website. There is no framework out there for fetching APIs easily.
**Languages**:- We used three languages mainly for building our website _HTML_, _CSS_,_JavaScript_.

## Challenges we ran into

We have never imagined our project to be challenging before we started. When we added the first API(Alpha Vantage) there was a memory _leak_ in NodeJS for which the website didn't run. We asked this to a mentor named, Sashrika, she gave us the stackoverflow link but that one also didn't work out. We got this error many times. Previously, we decided that we will use `NewsAPI` but it sucked most of our time and didn't run. Nathan, our mentor,also knows about this that we almost spent a day trying to work that out the news but it didn't. Finding the right APIs in a short period of time was quite challenging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we finally rendered the news API using NewYork times API. It almost took a whole day for rendering the right news API.

## What we learned

This was an amazing learning experience. We got more familiar with using some good APIs. We played around 4-5 APIs to find which one was working properly and which is gonna fit our website.

## What's next for Stocking

We are looking forward for the more development of our project. We want our website to be a bookmarked page for an investor. We are looking forward to creating our own API and our own node package. We also want our website to show the Logo of the website and the statistics of a particular company like the year when it was founded and many other cool features which we have never imagined.
